# Arduino-Basic
This is a very basic Arduino circuit that includes analog a digital pins for using on a project that may require a microcontroller permanently, and it was created using through hole components.
The KiCad files will be added (schematic, .lib, .net, etc) and on a different folder the GERBER and drill files.
The Gcode was done with FlatCam and those files will be added also.
